All tests should be run from top level directory of project bank_1/ as current working directory. Sorry, but we hard-coded some relative paths with that assumption.

Snapshot w/ Three-One Topology Test

This tests the correctness of our snapshot algorithm.
1. Start all four branches (most easily readable if each gets its own window)
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer aa_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer bb_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer cc_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer dd_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
2. Start test client
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.TestThreeOneSnapshot
Note that this test produces an exception stack trace at the branches when they try to contact their GUIs. But at that point, the debug output from the branches should already show the correct local sub-snapshot. If you were to also launch GUIs, they would receive the reply.

Single Branch Test

This tests the correctness of our partial rewrite of our branch request handling code.
1. Start a single branch
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer aa_server res/single_branch_names res/single_branch_topo
2. Start test client
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.TestSingleBranchServer

Ping Test

This tests the correctness of our partial rewrite of our networking code.
1. Start the echo server
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.PingEchoServer
2. Start the ping sender client
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.PingSender
