All tests should be run from top level directory of project bank_1/ as current working directory. Sorry, but we hard-coded some relative paths with that assumption.

Chain Replication w/o Failures Test

1. Start all 3 physical nodes (most easily readable if each gets its own window)
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer aa_server res/chain_repl_names res/ain_repl_topo res/chain_repl_branches
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer bb_server res/chain_repl_names res/ain_repl_topo res/chain_repl_branches
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer cc_server res/chain_repl_names res/ain_repl_topo res/chain_repl_branches
2. Start test client
java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.TestReplicationNoFail

Note that each physical node receives the initial message, but only the correct one responds.
Note that the message is passed along the physical nodes for the logical chain for that branch.
