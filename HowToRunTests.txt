All tests should be run from top level directory of project bank_1/ as current working directory. Sorry, but we hard-coded some relative paths with that assumption.

Snapshot w/ Three-One Topology Test

This tests the correctness of our snapshot algorithm.
	1. Start all four branches (most easily readable if each gets its own window)
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer aa_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer bb_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer cc_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer dd_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
	2. Start test client
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.TestThreeOneSnapshot

		Note that this test produces an exception stack trace at the branches when they try to contact their GUIs. But at that point, the debug output from the branches should already show the correct local sub-snapshot. If you were to also launch GUIs, they would receive the reply.

Single Branch Test

This tests the correctness of our partial rewrite of our branch request handling code.
	1. Start a single branch
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer aa_server res/single_branch_names res/single_branch_topo
	2. Start test client
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.TestSingleBranchServer

Ping Test

This tests the correctness of our partial rewrite of our networking code.
	1. Start the echo server
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.PingEchoServer
	2. Start the ping sender client
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.PingSender
		
Snapshot with GUI Test

This test ensures that the system works ok with the GUIs.
	1. Start all four branches (most easily readable if each gets its own window)
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer aa_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer bb_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer cc_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.network.BranchServer dd_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
	2. Start all four GUIs (most easily readable if each gets its own window)
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.branch.gui.BUI aa_gui aa_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.branch.gui.BUI bb_gui bb_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.branch.gui.BUI cc_gui cc_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.branch.gui.BUI dd_gui dd_server res/three_one_names res/three_one_topo
		[ After the GUIS are up easiest if you arrange them to visualize them seperately ]
	3. Load the initial data set: 
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.LoadDataTest
	4. Create a snapshot with the GUI.
		Go to one of the GUIs and create a snapshot request.
	5. Try to see a snapshot catching something in progress
		java -cp bin/ cs5414.bank.test.InTransitSnapshotTest
