This is the topology we used for many of our tests. It is called "three_one_topo" in our tests.
Its servers have the following network topology layout.

                            +------+
                            |      |<------------+
              +-------------|  C   |+-----------+|
              |             +------+            ||
              |                ^                ||               +------+
              |                |                ||               |      |
              |                |                ||               |  E   |
              v                +                v+               |      |
           +-----+          +------+         +-------+           +------+
           |     |          |      |         |       |              special node E, not a server!
           | A   |+-------->|  B   |<-------+|  D    |              just a debug request source
           +-----+          +------+         +-------+              connected to all servers

Each server has a corresponding GUI attached in a direct bi-directional link.
There is also a special node E which can talk to to all servers. It is ONLY FOR DEBUG/TESTING. Some unit tests take advantage of masquerading as E.
Note that E is NOT A SERVER and does not participate in snapshots or other server operations. It is not a branch and does not deal with accounts.
From the perspective of a snapshot, E ESSENTIALLY DOES NOT EXIST, because a snapshot only considers nodes named ending in "_server".

We tested our system from the GUI.

We wrote the following test clients and unit tests. See HowToRunTests.txt for more details.

- test of interleaving between multiple snapshots
- test of snapshot on topology with 4 nodes
- test of transactions on single branch
- test of network layer ping/pong
