For our tests, we used the following topology:

There are three nodes called aa, bb, cc
There are three branches called aa, bb, cc
All nodes host all branches
The order for aa is initially aa -> bb -> cc
... bb ... bb -> cc -> aa
... cc ... cc -> aa -> bb
Additionally, there is a node for the failure detection announcer
Additionally, there is an extra node for testing purposes

This topology is specified by the following files under the res/ directory:
chain_repl_names - specify physical node name/host/port
chain_repl_topo - specify node physical topo
chain_repl_branches - specify logical branch replication across physical nodes

We run the following tests:

test chain replication w/o failures
